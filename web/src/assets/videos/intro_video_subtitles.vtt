00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.960
Hello. So this is a short video that's going&nbsp;to take you through some information about this&nbsp;research project.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.042
If you're watching this video,&nbsp;you're currently taking part in a physical health study.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:18.395
Here at the GM Digital research unit, our aim is to use digital technology to improve people's mental health and well-being.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:22.970
With this&nbsp;research, we're looking at the connections between physical and mental health.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.066
Poor mental health&nbsp;is linked to multiple physical health conditions and people with chronic medical conditions are&nbsp;more likely to suffer from poor mental health,

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:36.115
so having separate approaches for the&nbsp;
treatment of physical and mental health&nbsp;can result in poorer outcomes.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:41.351
Understanding the&nbsp;relationship between these two equally important aspects of people's well-being

00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.292
is necessary&nbsp;for them to both be effectively treated.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.640
We are part of the Greater Manchester&nbsp;Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.572
and the project is linked to the University of&nbsp;Manchester.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.042
These lovely people are the team

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:56.104
and these are the partners.

00:00:56.104 --> 00:01:00.154
All this has been funded&nbsp;by this program and approved by these committees

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:03.460
who work to make sure your rights and well-being&nbsp;are protected.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:08.838
If you volunteer to take part, we have some questionnaires for you about your&nbsp;emotional well-being

00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:12.200
which will give us data to compare with your physical health study.

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:17.335
If you&nbsp;decide not to take part, it will not affect your physical health study so it's completely up to you.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:25.592
You do not need to have a history or diagnosis of mental illness or be experiencing any mental&nbsp;
health symptoms to take part in this research.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:31.841
The research may not personally benefit you directly,&nbsp;
but your participation could help countless others in the future.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:36.431
For example by collecting&nbsp;mental and physical health data together we can

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:42.905
design treatments for both physical and mental&nbsp;health, identify populations whose mental health needs are not being met

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.240
and also continue to&nbsp;reduce the stigma around mental health conditions

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.360
We have five questionnaires for you to complete,
but you can skip any of them if you like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.071
and even stop them halfway through if you change&nbsp;
your mind.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.210
You are free to withdraw from the research project at any time

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.302
with no impact on&nbsp;your physical health study.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:03.539
However we won't be able to delete any questionnaires you've already&nbsp;sent us

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.658
as you never enter your name or any other personal details into the questionnaires

00:02:07.658 --> 00:02:09.520
so we won't know which answers are yours.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.284
We will know your physical health study ID&nbsp;number which is used to link the two sets of&nbsp;data you are contributing towards.

00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:19.674
Our team will&nbsp;not be able to link your study ID to your name,

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:23.200
as the physical health study team&nbsp;will keep that information private.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.840
Data from your questionnaires will be&nbsp;transferred to the physical health study team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.760
using the same safeguards that are in place for&nbsp;
the storage of your physical health information.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
Similarly, we want to store your questionnaire&nbsp;
responses indefinitely so they can be used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.049
future research too, just like your physical&nbsp;health study.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.120
With your permission, we'd also love to share your non-identifiable questionnaire&nbsp;
data with other researchers working on similar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.520
projects so that other researchers can use your&nbsp;
data to help build healthier communities too.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.240
Your data will never be shared with your&nbsp;
GP or insurers, employers, telemarketers.&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.880
Finally, some members of the University of&nbsp;
Manchester or regulatory authorities may need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.600
look at the data collected in this study too, just&nbsp;
to make sure everything has been done as planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.360
In accordance with data protection law the&nbsp;
University of Manchester is the data controller,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.119
you're responsible for making sure all your&nbsp;
information is confidential, secure and used&nbsp;only in the way you've been told.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:29.694
When we have the&nbsp;results, these data will be used in academic books, reports, journals and conferences.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.853
To comply with UK&nbsp;data protection law our legal basis for collecting this research is that it is a public interest&nbsp;
task

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:39.680
and a process necessary for research purposes.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.810
You have a number of rights under data protection&nbsp;
laws and there will be a link to find out more about this after this video.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.486
Also when this video&nbsp;ends shortly you can see further information about this project and our past work

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:55.856
as well as a&nbsp;consent form you'll need to fill out if you choose to take part.

00:03:55.856 --> 00:04:04.437
There is also a link on how to remove&nbsp;your data from our project, as well as contact information if you have any complaints or queries&nbsp;for the researchers.

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:08.834
Thanks very much for watching.
