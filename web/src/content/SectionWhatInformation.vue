    We will collect your answers to the mental health questionnaires that you
    chose to complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would like to share your answers to the questionnaires with the physical
    health study team. This will enable them to examine the relationship between
    your physical and mental health, if they want to. The hyperlink you used to
    access the dataset contains your physical health study number so they can
    link the data. The CMHDS research team will not be able to link your study
    ID to your name. This is because the key which links your name and ID
    belongs to the physical health research team and will not be shared.
  </p>
  <p>
    In accordance with data protection law, The University of Manchester is the
    Data Controller for this project. This means that we are responsible for
    making sure your personal information is kept secure, confidential and used
    only in the way you have been told it will be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    All researchers are trained with this in mind, and your answers to the
    questionnaires will be looked after in the following way:
  </p>
  <h3>Step 1. Protecting your identity</h3>
  <p>
    As you are not entering your name or other identifiers (e.g., date of birth)
    into the website the CMHDS team will not know who you are. As you are
    entering your physical health study ID into the website the physical health
    study team will be able to identify you. No identifiable information will be
    shared beyond the physical health study team â€“ not even with the CMHDS team.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2. Securing your information</h3>
  <p>
    Protecting your data is very important to us. We take data security very
    seriously. Although no software system can eliminate all risks, we have made
    every effort to minimise the risks. The data in the website will be stored
    securely. Data from the website will be transferred to the physical health
    research study team, using a secure transfer system. The physical health
    team will store your mental health information using the same safeguards
    that are in place for storage of your physical health information.
  </p>
  <h3>Step 3: Who will receive my information</h3>
  <p>
    The physical health study team will receive a copy of your answers to the
    questionnaires.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would also like your permission for your
    <strong>non-identifiable</strong> data to be shared with other researchers
    for secondary analysis. Secondary analysis means that other researchers can
    examine your data and use it to answer a different research question.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will only share your <strong>non-identifiable</strong> data with other
    researchers from the NHS, universities, charities, not-for-profit or
    profit-making companies if you provide us with permission.
  </p>
  <p>We will <strong>NOT</strong> be sharing your information with</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your GP</li>
    <li>Insurers</li>
    <li>Employers</li>
    <li>Telemarketers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please also note that individuals from The University of Manchester or
    regulatory authorities may need to look at the data collected for this study
    to make sure the project is being carried out as planned. This will
    <strong>not</strong> involve looking at identifiable data. All individuals
    involved in auditing and monitoring the study will have a strict duty of
    confidentiality to you as a research participant. This means they have a
    duty to keep any information they see private.
  </p>
  <h3>Publishing</h3>
  <p>
    We would like to publish the results from the project in academic books,
    reports or journals and discuss the data at conferences. We will not publish
    any information which could identify who you are.
  </p>
  <h3>Withdrawal of permission for use</h3>
  <p>
    If you want to submit an application for your data to be removed from the
    project please see
    <a
      href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/privacy-information/data-protection/your-rights/"
      >https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/privacy-information/data-protection/your-rights/</a
    >
  </p>
  <h3>Destroying/disposing of your information</h3>
  <p>
    We would like to store your mental health data together with your physical
    health data indefinitely (for an unlimited/unspecified period of time). This
    is so it can be used for future research.
