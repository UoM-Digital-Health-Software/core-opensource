    Poor mental health is linked to multiple physical health conditions, for
    example, diabetes, heart disease and early death.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individuals with chronic medical conditions are also more likely to suffer
    from poor mental health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having separate approaches for the treatment of physical and mental health
    can result in poorer physical health for people with mental illness, as well
    as poorer mental health for people with physical illnesses, particularly for
    those with long-term conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important that researchers and clinicians understand the relationship
    between physical and mental health so that both, equally important, aspects
    of peopleâ€™s wellbeing can be effectively treated.
