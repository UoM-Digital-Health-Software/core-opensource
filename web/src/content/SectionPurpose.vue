  <p>The research involves completing emotional well-being questionnaires.</p>
  <p>
    We are asking people who are taking part in a physical health study to
    complete these questionnaires because we are interested in the relationship
    between physical and mental health.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are being asked to take part because you are a participant in a physical
    health study.
  </p>
  <p>
    You do not need to have a history or diagnosis of mental illness, or to be
    experiencing any mental health symptoms, to take part in this research.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is up to you whether you take part in this study. If you do not want to
    take part, it will not affect your participation in the physical health
    research study.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will now provide you with some information about the project, to help you
    make a decision whether or not to take part.
