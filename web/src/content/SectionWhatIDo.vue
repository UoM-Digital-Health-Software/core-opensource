    We will ask you to complete 5 questionnaires that are designed to assess
    people's emotional well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the questionnaires are optional to complete, and you can skip
    questionnaires if you want to.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is up to you to decide whether to take part. If you do not want to take
    part, you can exit the website at any time using the exit button below.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do decide to take part, you can download a copy of the information
    about the project here and you will be asked to complete a consent form.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you decide to take part, you are free to withdraw at any time without
    giving a reason and without it affecting your involvement in the physical
    health study. However, it will not be possible for the CMHDS team to remove
    your answers to the questionnaires from the research once they have been
    entered into the website. This is because you will not be asked to enter any
    identifiable information, such as your name, into the website, meaning we
    will not know which answers are yours. This does not affect your data
    protection rights.
